# Discord-24-7-Radio-Bot-
Hello there, basic and cool 24/7, hybrid 24/7 Discord bot. If you're interested, reach me on Discord: voniha

General:
- The bot is made with lavalink v4.
- Uses context menus commands just for simplicity.

Available commands:
- Bot Latency - checks the bot's api latency.
- Change Mode - Switches modes between 24/7 and hybrid 24/7.
- Logging System - Enables or disables logging nowplaying songs changes in a specific text channel.
- Refresh Connection - Manually refreshes connection if it's bad.

Features
- Pauses radio live stream to not waste resources when nobody is listening.
- When nobody is listening, it leaves the channel.
- When first listener joins it also joins the channel.
- Changing channel's status to nowplaying song.

Difference between 24/7 and hybrid 24/7:

24/7 - Bot stays in channel always, but pauses the live stream to avoid wasting resources.
Hybrid 24/7 - Bot leaves the channel if no one is listening then joins if first listener joins again.

You can always suggest something to add and you'll get the newest update if there is any. The price is negotiable.
